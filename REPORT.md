### Queue Implementation 

( NEEDS WORK. IDK MUCH ABOUT THIS)

### UThread Implementation

For this part, we used a struct called TCB that stores the following:
- TID: thread identifier
- context: context for the program
- stack: stack needed for the thread
- retVal: On exiting, the return value is assigned to this
- isBlocked: Checks if the thread is Blocked. 
- *retValSave: pointer where we want to store the retval for a certain TID
- tidWait: If the thread is blocked, then this is the identifier for the TID of the blocked thread
