# User-Level-Thread

## Completed Phases:
- 5.1 (Pull Skeleton Code)
- 5.2 (Queue Implementation, Makefile, and Testing)

## To-do Phases:
- 5.3
- 5.4
- 5.5

## Makefile Guide:
- For this project, we only need to run 'make' in the 'progs' directory
- That Makefile would then run our own Makefile located in 'libuthread' directory, which compiles a statically linked library called 'libuthread.a'
- We do not need to make any changes to the Makefile that the instructor provided
- To add more dependencies (currently only 'queue.c' and 'uthread.c'), we can add more logic into the Makefile in 'libuthread' directory
